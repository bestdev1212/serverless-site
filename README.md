# Serverless Site

Uses react, react-router, redux and [Phenomic](https://github.com/MoOx/phenomic) under the hood.

This site is completely serverless!

# Setup

You will need to change the `.env.sample` to `.env` and input the correct credentials.

Serverless folks our credentials are in 1password secure note in Shared titled: 'Site .env settings'

Once the .env file is configured with the correct API keys you can run the local site.
